/**
 * High-level client for interacting with the Umbra Privacy protocol smart contracts.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `UmbraClient` provides a simplified, user-friendly interface for interacting with
 * the Umbra Privacy protocol without requiring any knowledge of the underlying architecture,
 * cryptographic primitives, or implementation details. It abstracts away the complexity of:
 * - Key derivation and management
 * - Transaction construction and signing
 * - Zero-knowledge proof generation
 * - Rescue cipher encryption/decryption
 * - Transaction forwarding and confirmation
 * - Network connectivity and RPC management
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Simplified API**: Interact with Umbra Privacy smart contracts using high-level methods
 * - **Automatic Management**: Handles wallet creation, key derivation, and cipher management automatically
 * - **Flexible Forwarding**: Supports multiple transaction forwarding strategies (direct RPC, relayer services)
 * - **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with branded types for enhanced safety
 * - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for better debugging and error recovery
 *
 * **Architecture Abstraction:**
 * The client manages all the complex components internally:
 * - **UmbraWallets**: Cryptographic wallets that handle key derivation, signing, and encryption
 * - **Transaction Forwarders**: Components that submit transactions to the network with various strategies
 * - **Connection Management**: Handles Solana network connectivity and RPC interactions
 *
 * Users can focus on their application logic while the client handles all protocol-specific
 * operations behind the scenes.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The return type for transaction forwarding operations (defaults to `SolanaTransactionSignature`)
 *
 * @public
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create client from RPC URL (simplest approach)
 * const client = UmbraClient.create('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
 *
 * // Create client from Connection instance
 * const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
 * const client = UmbraClient.create(connection);
 *
 * // Create client from existing forwarder
 * const forwarder = ConnectionBasedForwarder.fromRpcUrl('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
 * const client = UmbraClient.create(forwarder);
 *
 * // Access managed components
 * const wallets = client.umbraWallets;
 * const forwarders = client.txForwarders;
 * const connectionForwarder = client.connectionBasedForwarder;
 * ```
